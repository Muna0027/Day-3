//Isn't this contingent on the actual time my computer has? Am I supposed to manually input the time (hours and minutes) so I can prove that I can make (07hours and 05minutes) work? If that is not the case then the answer is complete. 

//You are supposed to come up with a way to make the time start with a 0 for both minutes and hours. I tested the theory by changing my computers set time to a different time zone.
